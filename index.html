            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I hold a BSc and PhD from the Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.
                My thesis was on <b>Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Methodologies</b>, focusing on <b>Robotic
                Vision</b> tasks as well as timeseries analysis, mainly concerning <b>Gravitational Wave</b> data. I've also been
                actively involved in multiple research projects, ranging from robotics to financial and energy-load
                forecasting.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently working as a <b>Senior Data Scientist</b> at the <a href="https://www.datascience.ch/">Swiss Data Science Center</a>
                in Zürich, Switzerland.

            <h4>OpenDR [<a href="https://opendr.eu">website</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/opendr-eu/opendr">github</a>]</h4>

            <p>Developing an open, modular, non-proprietary toolkit for core robotic capabilities. My contribution pertains to
            Deep Learning-based 2D image analysis tools, like object recognition, detection and tracking, both human-centric and environmental.
            Developed tools in <b>PyTorch</b> and <b>MXNet</b> and corresponding <b>ROS</b> nodes.</p>

            <h4>DeepFinance [<a href="https://deepfinance.csd.auth.gr">website</a>]</h4>

            <p>R&D in Deep Learning for portfolio management, based on financial timeseries analysis as well as semantic analysis
            of social media posts related to the financial assets at hand. My role: development of relevant models and management of the project.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rcorners3">
            <h4>MALENA [<a href="https://malena.csd.auth.gr">website</a>]</h4>

            <p>Electrical load demand forecasting using Deep Learning.
                My role: researching DL-based regression methods for the ELDF problem.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rcorners3">
            <h4>Virgo-AUTH</h4>

            <p>I've been a member of the Virgo-AUTH team since 2019, researching DL-based methods for improved surrogate waveform modelling,
            as well as Gravitational Wave detection in real noise, competing in the first Machine Learning Mock Data Challenge
                [<a href="https://github.com/gwastro/ml-mock-data-challenge-1">MLGWSC-1</a>]. Our model
                [<a href="https://github.com/vivinousi/gw-detection-deep-learning">AResGW</a>] outperformed other ML-based methods
                in real noise from O3a, and an improved version [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01520">arXiv</a>] further decreased the gap between ML
                and matched filtering based methods.

            <h4>MultiDrone [<a href="https://multidrone.eu">website</a>]</h4>

            <p>Developing a multi-drone system for autonomous sports-related cinematography. My research was focused on
            lightweight Deep Learning methods for robotic vision, as the drones were equipped with NVIDIA Jetson TX2 modules.
            I developed <b>ROS</b> nodes for joint detection-tracking after researching a method for long-term classification-based
                redetection tracking [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2020.115969">paper</a>].</p>
